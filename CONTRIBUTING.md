# Introduction

You can contribute to Spinal Cord Toolbox by opening a Pull Request. Direct push to the `master` branch is forbidden.

If your are new to git or github, the following articles may help you:

* See [Using Pull Requests](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests) for more information about Pull Requests.
* See [Fork A Repo](http://help.github.com/forking/) for an introduction to forking a repository.
* See [Creating branches](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-and-deleting-branches-within-your-repository/) for an introduction on branching within GitHub.
* See [Refining patches using git](https://github.com/erlang/otp/wiki/Refining-patches-using-git) for an introduction to cleaning up git branches.

# Reporting/Fixing a bug

## Reporting a bug

Please use the following template to structure the bug report:

    Title: Summary of the issue. ex:"Crashes during image cropping."
    Environment: Specify what OS and SCT version you are using.
    Step to reproduce: List all the steps that caused the issue, including the syntax
    Data that caused the issue: when possible/relevant, copy the data there: `duke:sct_testing/issues`
    Expected results:
    Actual results:

Please use label: [BUG] & [function] (see list of labels [here](https://github.com/neuropoly/spinalcordtoolbox/labels))

Example of bug report here: Example here: https://github.com/neuropoly/spinalcordtoolbox/issues/444

## Fixing a bug

* In most cases, pull requests for bug fixes should be based on the `master` branch.
* Write a test case before fixing the bug (so that you will know that the test case catches the bug). For applications without a test suite in the git repository, it would be appreciated if you provide a small code sample in the commit message or email a module that will provoke the failure.
* Indicate issue number in the commit (see commit section below)
* Do not close the issue yourself. The issue will be automatically closed when changes are pushed to master.

# Adding a new feature

* In most cases, pull requests for new features should be based on the master branch.
* It is important to write a good commit message explaining why the feature is needed. We prefer that the information is in the commit message, so that anyone that want to know two years later why a particular feature can easily find out. It does no harm to provide the same information in the pull request (if the pull request consists of a single commit, the commit message will be added to the pull request automatically).
* With few exceptions, it is mandatory to write a new test case that tests the feature. The test case is needed to ensure that the features does not stop working in the future.
* If you are implementing a new feature, also update the documentation to describe the feature.
* Make sure to cite any papers, algorithms or articles that can help understand the implementation of the feature.

## Feature request template

When proposing a new feature, a discussion will be conducted around the feature. Here a good way to present the new feature in the github issues.

    Title: [FEATURE] Summary of the feature.

    Motivation: Explain why the feature is needed.
    Use Case: Explain how the feature will be used, provide all the necessary steps.
    Expected Outcome: What will the outcome be.
    Citation: Provide references to any theoretical work to help the reader better understand the feature.

# Naming your branch

When submitting PRs to SCT, please try to follow our convention and have your branches named as follows:

- If you're working on the upstream SCT repository, prefix the branch name with a personal identifier and a forward slash;
- If the branch you're working on is in response to an issue, provide the issue number;
- Try to add some additional text that make the branch name meaningful during its life cycle.

Rationale:
- A merge commit header contains by default the name of the branch to be merged
- When working in the main SCT repo, the personal prefix makes the branch list prettier and more meaningful
- As much as Emojis are used a lot in our github, non-ascii branch names are not OK (spelling is too hard)

Examples:

Best:
- sct_propseg-fixup-div0
  - outside contribution assumed
  - can reasonably see what it's about
- jca/1234-rewrite-sct-in-cobol
  - can see who is doing it without looking at the code
  - can see that there is an issue about it
  - can see what it's about and that it's time to change the trajectory of this issue

OK:
- jca/1828
  - you're busy with the science and don't care what the commit log will look like or that nobody else will know what this is about, nor you in one week... but it's OK since the branch will be deleted anyway after merge

Bad:
- wip-on-something
  - yeah like we can figure that one out without looking at the code
- ◊ñ◊ê◊™, cJ/üòä-fixed-all-bugs
  - please no ;)

# Update your branch with master

## git pull --rebase vs. git pull

In general, to update your local repository please use:
~~~
git pull --rebase
~~~
Instead of `git pull`, which is equivalent to `git fetch` + `git merge` commands, which will result with an extra commit and ugly merge bubbles in your commit log. More details [here](https://coderwall.com/p/7aymfa/please-oh-please-use-git-pull-rebase).

# Commit changes to your branch

Here are some tips to help the review go smoothly and quickly.

1. Keep it short. Keep the changes less then 50 lines.
2. Focus on committing 1 logical change at a time.
3. Write a verbose commit message. [Detailed explanation of a good commit message](https://github.com/erlang/otp/wiki/writing-good-commit-messages)
4. Correct any code style suggested by an analyser on your changes. [PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/pycharm/2016.1/code-inspection.html) has a code analyser integrated or you can use [pyflakes](https://github.com/PyCQA/pyflakes). The only suggestion we are ignoring is the line length.

## Commit message

### Title

The title should be short (50 chars or less), and should explicitly summarize the changes. If it solves an issue, add at the end: "fixes #ISSUE_NUMBER". The message should be preceded by one of the following flags:

```
BUG:   - a change made to fix a runtime issue (crash, segmentation fault, exception, incorrect result)
REF:   - refactoring (edits that don't impact the execution, renaming files, etc.)
OPT:   - a performance improvement, optimization, enhancement
BIN:   - any change related to binary files (should rarely be used)
NEW:   - new functionality added to the project (e.g., new function)
DOC:   - changes not related to the code (comments, documentation, etc.).
TEST:  - any change related to the testing (e.g., sct_test_propseg, .travis, etc.)
DEV:   - related to development (under /dev folder)
INST:  - a modification in the installation/package creation of SCT
```  

An example commit title might be:
```
BUG: Re-ordering of 4th dimension when apply transformation on 4D scans (fixes #1635)
````

### Description

```
Add more detailed explanatory text, if necessary.  Wrap it to about 72
characters or so.  In some contexts, the first line is treated as the
subject of an email and the rest of the text as the body.  The blank
line separating the summary from the body is critical (unless you omit
the body entirely); tools like rebase can get confused if you run the
two together.

Further paragraphs come after blank lines.

  - Bullet points are okay, too

  - Typically a hyphen or asterisk is used for the bullet, preceded by a
    single space, with blank lines in between, but conventions vary here

# Submit a pull request

We usually prefer specialized PRs that address one issue (it could be more if all issues falling in the PR are inter-related). The title of the PR should be specific to the issue.

### Title
The title should be short (50 chars or less), and should explicitly summarize the purpose of the PR. The PR title is used to automatically generate the [Changelog](https://github.com/neuropoly/spinalcordtoolbox/blob/master/CHANGES.md) for each new release. Do not include the issue number in the title (do it in the PR description). 

### Description
If the PR fixes some issues, please write it as follows: "Fixes #XXXX, Fixes #YYYY, Fixes ZZZZ". That syntax will automatically close the related issues upon merging.

### Labels
To help assigning reviewers and organizing the Changelog, add labels that describe the [category](https://github.com/neuropoly/spinalcordtoolbox/wiki/Label-definition#issue-category) and type of the change. A change can have multiple types if it is appropriate but **it can only have one category**. [Here](https://github.com/neuropoly/spinalcordtoolbox/pull/1637) is an example of PR with proper labels and description.

# Code Review 

[What is code review?](https://help.github.com/articles/about-pull-request-reviews/)

Any changes submitted to the master branch will go through code review. For a pull request to be accepted it must have:

* At least 2 members approve the changes.
* TravisCI must pass successfully

Reviewing members are :
* @jcohenadad
* @zougloub
* @charleygros
* @fperdigon

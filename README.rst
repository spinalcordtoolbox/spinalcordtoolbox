**Spinal Cord Toolbox (SCT)** is a comprehensive, free and open-source set of command-line tools dedicated to the processing and analysis of spinal cord MRI data.

Key Features
------------

- Segmentation of the spinal cord and gray matter
- Segmentation of pathologies (e.g. multiple sclerosis lesions)
- Detection of anatomical highlights (e.g. ponto-medullary junction, spinal cord centerline, vertebral levels)
- Registration to template, and deformation (e.g. straightening)
- Motion correction for diffusion and functional MRI time series
- Computation of quantitative MRI metrics (e.g. diffusion tensor imaging, magnetization transfer)
- Texture analysis (e.g. grey level co-occurrence matrix)
- Extraction of metrics within anatomical regions (e.g. white matter tracts)
- Manual labeling and segmentation via a Graphical User Interface (GUI)
- Warping field creation and application
- NIFTI volume manipulation tools for common operations


Installation
------------

For macOS and Linux users, the simplest way to install SCT is to download `the latest release <https://github.com/spinalcordtoolbox/spinalcordtoolbox/releases>`_, then launch the install script:

.. code::

   ./install_sct

For more complex installation setups (Windows users, Docker, FSLeyes integration), see the `Installation <https://spinalcordtoolbox.com/en/latest/user_section/installation.html>`_ page.


Usage
-----

Once installed, there are three main ways to use SCT:

**1. Command-line tools**

The primary way to invoke SCT is through terminal commands. For example:

.. code-block:: console

  $ sct_deepseg_sc -i t2.nii.gz -c t2

  Cropping the image around the spinal cord...
  Normalizing the intensity...
  Segmenting the spinal cord using deep learning on 2D patches...
  Reassembling the image...
  Resampling the segmentation to the native image resolution using linear interpolation...
  Binarizing the resampled segmentation...
  Compute shape analysis: 100%|################| 55/55 [00:00<00:00, 106.05iter/s]

  Done! To view results, type:
  fsleyes t2.nii.gz -cm greyscale t2_seg.nii.gz -cm red -a 70.0 &

For a full overview of the available commands, see the `Command-Line Tools <https://spinalcordtoolbox.com/en/stable/user_section/command-line.html>`_ page.

**2. Multi-command pipelines**

To facilitate multi-subject analyses, commands can be chained together to build processing pipelines. The best starting point for constructing a typical pipeline is the `batch_processing.sh <https://spinalcordtoolbox.com/en/latest/user_section/getting-started.html#batch-processing-example>`_ script, which is provided with your installation of SCT.

**3. GUI (FSLeyes integration)**

SCT provides a graphical user interface via a FSLeyes plugin. For more details, see the `FSLeyes Integration <https://spinalcordtoolbox.com/en/latest/user_section/fsleyes.html>`_ page.

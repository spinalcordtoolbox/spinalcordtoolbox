# CHANGES TO RELEASE

XXX

- NEW: sct_crop: function to quickly crop an image.
- NEW: sct_extract_metric (replaces the old sct_estimate_MAP_tracts.py). New functionalities added (maximum likelihood estimation and tract grouping). More flexible with label files.
- NEW: sct_convert_mnc2nii
- NEW: sct_create_mask: create mask of different shapes (cylinder, box, gaussian). Useful for moco.
- NEW: sct_fmri_moco: motion correction function for fMRI data. Uses regularization along z.
- OPT: new version of the white matter atlas: more accurate, deformation accounting for internal structure (use BSplineSyN instead of SyN).
- OPT: sct_dmri_moco now using ANTs for more robustness and better spline interpolation.
- OPT: removed all .py extensions for callable functions (created links)
- INST: now possible to specify installation path for the toolbox
- INST: added pillow (fixed issue #117)
- REF: sct_straighten_spinalcord (fixed issues #56, #116)

1.0.3 (2014-07-30)

- BUG: fixed bug in sct_process_segmentation.py related to import of scipy.misc imsave,imread in miniconda distrib (issue #62)
- BUG: fixed bug in sct_process_segmentation.py related to import of PIL/Pillow module (issue #58)
- OPT: sct_register_multimodal now working for images with non-axial orientation (issue #59)
- OPT: sct_register_straight_spinalcord_to_template has now been replaced by sct_register_multimodal in sct_register_to_template.
- OPT: major improvements for sct_dmri_moco, including spline regularization, eddy correction, group-wise registration, gaussian mask.
- OPT: sct_check_dependencies.py can now output log file and do extensive tests (type -h for more info)
- NEW: sct_apply_transfo.py: apply warping field (wrapper to ANTs WarpImageMultiTransform)
- NEW: sct_concat_transfo.py: concatenate warping fields (wrapper to ANTs ComposeMultiTransform)
- NEW: batch_processing.sh: example batch for processing multi-parametric data

1.0.2 (2014-07-13)

- NEW: virtual machine
- BUG: fixed sct_check_dependencies for Linux
- BUG: fix VM failure of sct_register_to_template (issue #41)
- OPT: sct_register_to_template.py now registers the straight spinal cord to the template using sct_register_multimodal.py, which uses the spinal cord segmentation for more accurate results.

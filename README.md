## Introduction
![SCT overview](abstract.png "Spinal Cord Toolbox overview")

For the past 25 years, the field of neuroimaging has witnessed the
development of several software packages for processing multi-parametric
magnetic resonance imaging (mpMRI) to study the brain. These software packages
are now routinely used by researchers and clinicians, and have contributed to
important breakthroughs for the understanding of brain anatomy and function.
However, no software package exists to process mpMRI data of the spinal cord.
Despite the numerous clinical needs for such advanced mpMRI protocols (multiple
sclerosis, spinal cord injury, cervical spondylotic myelopathy, etc.),
researchers have been developing specific tools that, while necessary, do not
provide an integrative framework that is compatible with most usages and that is
capable of reaching the community at large. This hinders cross-validation and
the possibility to perform multi-center studies.

**Spinal Cord Toolbox (SCT)** is a comprehensive, free and open-source software dedicated to the
processing and analysis of spinal cord MRI data. **SCT** builds on
previously-validated methods and includes state-of-the-art MRI templates and
atlases of the spinal cord, algorithms to segment and register new data to the
templates, and motion correction methods for diffusion and functional time
series. **SCT** is tailored towards standardization and automation of the
processing pipeline, versatility, modularity, and it follows guidelines of
software development and distribution. Preliminary applications of **SCT** cover
a variety of studies, from cross-sectional area measures in large databases of
patients, to the precise quantification of mpMRI metrics in specific spinal
pathways. We anticipate that **SCT** will bring together the spinal cord
neuroimaging community by establishing standard templates and analysis
procedures.


## Installation

### Install from package (release)

The simplest way to install SCT is to do it via a stable release. First, download the [latest release](https://github.com/neuropoly/spinalcordtoolbox/releases). Major changes to each release are listed [here](CHANGES.md).

Dependencies:
- OS requirements:
  * OS X >= 10.12
  * Debian >=9
  * Ubuntu >= 16.04
  * Fedora >= 19
  * RedHat/CentOS >= 7
  * Windows, see [Installation with Docker](#installation-with-docker).
- You need to have `gcc` installed. On OS X, we recommend installing [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) and then run `brew install gcc`. On Linux, we recommend installing it via your package manager. For example on Debian/Ubuntu: `apt install gcc`, and on CentOS/RedHat: `yum -y install gcc`. 

Once you have downloaded SCT, unpack it (note: Safari will automatically unzip it). Then, open a new Terminal, go into the created folder and launch the installer:

~~~
./install_sct
~~~

### Install from Github (development)

Download source code from Github (N.B. you need to have git installed):

~~~
git clone --branch=master https://github.com/neuropoly/spinalcordtoolbox.git sct
~~~

Then install SCT:

~~~
cd sct
./install_sct
~~~

At anytime, you can update your local SCT installation to the latest version on Github:

~~~
git pull
~~~


### Installation with Windows Subsystem for Linux (Windows 10).

Windows subsystem for Linux (WSL) is available on Windows 10 and it makes it possible to run native Linux programs, such as SCT. 

[Tutorial to install SCT on WSL](https://github.com/neuropoly/spinalcordtoolbox/wiki/SCT-on-Windows-10:-Installation-instruction-for-SCT-on-Windows-subsytem-for-linux)


### Installation with Docker

If none of the above solution work, SCT can be installed via Docker. 

[Tutorial to install SCT via Docker](https://github.com/neuropoly/spinalcordtoolbox/wiki/testing#run-docker-image)



## Getting started

The best way to learn about the main functionalities of SCT is to run a typical processing pipeline, in the form of a 
batch script. We provide an example dataset (includes T1w, T2w, T2\*w, DTI and fMRI) with a collection of commands to 
process those files and output quantitative parameters.

- Open a Terminal
- Run: `$SCT_DIR/batch_processing.sh`
- While the processing is being done, we encourage you to look at the [batch script](batch_processing.sh) and try to understand the mean of each command line. If you have any question, please do not hesitate to post on the [forum](http://forum.spinalcordmri.org/c/sct).

If you would like to get more examples about what SCT can do, please visit [this address](https://github.com/sct-pipeline/).
Each repository is a pipeline dedicated to a specific research project.

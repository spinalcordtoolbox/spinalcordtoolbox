![Spinal Cord Toolbox overview](abstract.png "Spinal Cord Toolbox overview")

For the past 25 years, the field of neuroimaging has witnessed the
development of several software packages for processing multi-parametric
magnetic resonance imaging (mpMRI) to study the brain. These software packages
are now routinely used by researchers and clinicians, and have contributed to
important breakthroughs for the understanding of brain anatomy and function.
However, no software package exists to process mpMRI data of the spinal cord.
Despite the numerous clinical needs for such advanced mpMRI protocols (multiple
sclerosis, spinal cord injury, cervical spondylotic myelopathy, etc.),
researchers have been developing specific tools that, while necessary, do not
provide an integrative framework that is compatible with most usages and that is
capable of reaching the community at large. This hinders cross-validation and
the possibility to perform multi-center studies.

Spinal Cord Toolbox (SCT) is a comprehensive, free and open-source software dedicated to the
processing and analysis of spinal cord **MRI** data. **SCT** builds on
previously-validated methods and includes state-of-the-art **MRI** templates and
atlases of the spinal cord, algorithms to segment and register new data to the
templates, and motion correction methods for diffusion and functional time
series. **SCT** is tailored towards standardization and automation of the
processing pipeline, versatility, modularity, and it follows guidelines of
software development and distribution. Preliminary applications of **SCT** cover
a variety of studies, from cross-sectional area measures in large databases of
patients, to the precise quantification of mpMRI metrics in specific spinal
pathways. We anticipate that **SCT** will bring together the spinal cord
neuroimaging community by establishing standard templates and analysis
procedures.

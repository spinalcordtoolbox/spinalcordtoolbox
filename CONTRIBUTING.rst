Introduction
------------

First off, thanks for taking the time to contribute! üéâ

When contributing to this repository, please first discuss the change you wish
to make by opening a new `Github issue <https://github.com/neuropoly/spinalcordtoolbox/issues>`_.

Contributions relating to content of the Github repository can be
submitted through Github pull requests (PR).

PR for bug fixes or new features should be based on the
`master` branch.

The following Github documentation may be useful:

-   See `Using Pull Requests <https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests>`_ for
    more information about Pull Requests.
-   See `Fork A Repo <http://help.github.com/forking/>`_ for an
    introduction to forking a repository.
-   See `Creating branches <https://help.github.com/articles/creating-and-deleting-branches-within-your-repository/>`_
    for an introduction on branching within GitHub.

**For external contributors:** Please fork this repository, make the desired
changes, and open a Pull request to have your code reviewed and merged.

**For internal contributor:** You can open a
branch (see :ref:`contributing:Opening a branch`) directly in this repository. If you don't
have the rights, contact the team leader.


Opening an issue
----------------

Issues (bugs, feature requests, or others) can be submitted
`on our project's issue page
<https://github.com/neuropoly/spinalcordtoolbox/issues>`_.


Before Submitting a New Issue
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Please take a few seconds to search the issue database in case the
issue has already been raised.

When reporting an issue, make sure your installation has not been tempered
with (and if you can, update to the latest release, maybe the problem was
fixed).


Submitting an Issue
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Issue Title
^^^^^^^^^^^

Try to have a self-descriptive, meaningful issue title, summarizing the problem you see. Do not add the function name, because this will be taken care of by the `Issue Labels`_. 

Examples:

- *Installation failure: problem creating launchers*
- *Crashes during image cropping*
- *Add a special mode for squirrel WM/GM segmentation*


Issue Body
^^^^^^^^^^

**Describe** the issue and mention the SCT version and OS that you are using.

If you experience an error, copy/paste the Terminal output (include your syntax) and please follow these guidelines for clarity:

- If there is less than 10 lines of text, embed it directly in your comment in github. Use "~~~" to format as code.

- If there is 10+ lines, either use an external website such as `pastebin <https://pastebin.com/>`_ (copy/paste your text and include the URL in your comment), or use `collapsable Github markdown capabilities <https://gist.github.com/ericclemmons/b146fe5da72ca1f706b2ef72a20ac39d#using-details-in-github>`_.

Provide steps to **reproduce** the issue. Try to reproduce your issue using ``sct_testing_data`` or
``sct_example_data`` as inputs, and to provide a sequence of commands
that can reproduce it. If this is not possible, try to isolate a minimal input on which the issue
happens (eg. one file among a dataset), and provide this file publicly,
or if not possible, privately (coordinate with @jcohenadad).

Add useful information such as screenshots, etc.

If you submit a feature request, provide a *usage scenario*, imagining
how the feature would be used (ideally inputs, a sequence of commands,
and a desired outcome). Also provide references to any theoretical work to help the reader
better understand the feature.


Issue Labels
^^^^^^^^^^^^

To help assigning reviewers and organizing the Changelog, add labels
that describe the `category <https://github.com/neuropoly/spinalcordtoolbox/wiki/Label-definition#category>`_
and type of issue.


Issue Examples
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Some good real-life examples:

- https://github.com/neuropoly/spinalcordtoolbox/issues/2240
- https://github.com/neuropoly/spinalcordtoolbox/issues/2236
- https://github.com/neuropoly/spinalcordtoolbox/issues/2245


Opening a Branch
----------------

If you are part of the core developer team, you can open a branch
directly in this repository. Prefix the branch name with a personal
identifier and a forward slash; If the branch you are working on is in
response to an issue, provide the issue number; Add some text that make
the branch name meaningful.

Examples:

-  ``ol/100-fixup-lr-scheduler``
-  ``ab/loader-pep8``


Developing
----------

Conflicts
~~~~~~~~~

Make sure the PR changes are not in conflict with the master branch.

Code style
~~~~~~~~~~

Please review your changes for styling issues, clarity, according to the
`PEP8 convention <https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/>`__. Correct
any code style suggested by an analyzer on your changes.
`PyCharm <https://www.jetbrains.com/help/pycharm/2016.1/code-inspection.html>`__
has a code analyser integrated or you can use
`pyflakes <https://github.com/PyCQA/pyflakes>`__.

Do not address your functional changes in the same commits as any
styling clean-up you may be doing on existing code.

Documentation and docstrings
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you are implementing a new feature, update the documentation to
describe the feature, and comment the code (things that are not
trivially understandable from the code) to improve its maintainability.

Make sure to cite any papers, algorithms or articles that can help
understand the implementation of the feature. If you are implementing an
algorithm described in a paper, add pointers to the section / steps.

Please use the `Google style
docstrings <https://sphinxcontrib-napoleon.readthedocs.io/en/latest/example_google.html>`__.

Testing
~~~~~~~

Please add tests, especially with new code. As of now, we have integration tests (that run in `sct_testing`),
and unit tests (in `/unit_testing/`). They are straightforward to augment, but we understand
it's the extra mile; it would still be appreciated if you provide
something lighter (eg. in the commit messages or in the PR or issue
text) that demonstrates that an issue was fixed, or a feature is
functional.

Consider that if you add test cases, they will ensure that your feature
-- which you probably care about -- does not stop working in the future.

Licensing
~~~~~~~~~

Ensure that you are the original author of your changes, and if that is
not the case, ensure that the borrowed/adapted code is compatible with
the `project's
license <https://github.com/neuropoly/spinalcordtoolbox/blob/master/LICENSE>`__.


Committing
----------

Commit Titles
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Provide a concise and self-descriptive title (avoid > 80 characters).
You may "scope" the title using the applicable command name(s), folder
or other "module" as a prefix. If a commit is responsible for fixing an
issue, post-fix the description with ``(fixes #ISSUE_NUMBER)``.

Examples:

::

    testing: add testing function for validation metrics
    loader: add timer
    documentation: add slice_axis to the config files
    model: add HeMIS network

Commit Sequences
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Update your branch to be baseline on the latest master if new
developments were merged while you were developing. Please prefer
**rebasing** to merging, as explained in `this
tutorial <https://coderwall.com/p/7aymfa/please-oh-please-use-git-pull-rebase>`__.
Note that if you do rebases after review have started, they will be
cancelled, so at this point it may be more appropriate to do a pull.

Clean-up your commit sequence. If your are not familiar with git, `this
good
tutorial <https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/rewriting-history>`__
on the subject may help you.

Focus on committing 1 logical change at a time. See `this
article <https://github.com/erlang/otp/wiki/writing-good-commit-messages>`__
on the subject.


Submitting a Pull Request
-------------------------

PR Title
~~~~~~~~

The PR title is used to automatically generate the
`Changelog <https://github.com/neuropoly/spinalcordtoolbox/blob/master/CHANGES.md>`__
for each new release, so please follow the following rules:

-  Provide a concise and self-descriptive title (see :ref:`contributing:Issue Title`).
-  Do not include the applicable issue number in the title, do it in the PR body (see :ref:`contributing:PR Body`).
-  If the PR is not ready for review, convert it to a draft.

PR Body
~~~~~~~

Describe what the PR is about, explain the approach and possible
drawbacks. Don't hesitate to repeat some of the text from the related
issue (easier to read than having to click on the link).

If the PR fixes issue(s), indicate it after your introduction:
``Fixes #XXXX, Fixes #YYYY``. Note: it is important to respect the
syntax above so that the issue(s) will be closed upon merging the PR.

PR Labels
~~~~~~~~~

You **must** add labels to PRs, as these are used to automatically generate Changelog:

- **Category:** Choose **one** label that describes the
  `category <https://github.com/neuropoly/spinalcordtoolbox/wiki/Label-definition#category>`_
  (white font over purple background).

- **SCT Function:** Choose one or multiple labels corresponding to the SCT functions that are mainly affected by the PR (black font over
  light purple background).

- **Cross-compatibility:** If your PR breaks cross-compatibility with a previous stable release of SCT, you should add the
  label ``compatibility``.

Work in progress 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If your PR is not ready for review yet, you can convert it to a "Draft", so the team is informed.

A draft pull request is styled differently to clearly indicate that it‚Äôs in a draft state. 
Merging is blocked in draft pull requests. Change the status to ‚ÄúReady for review‚Äù near the 
bottom of your pull request to remove the draft state and allow merging according to your 
project‚Äôs settings. 

Continuous Integration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The PR can't be merged if `Github Actions "Run
tests" <https://travis-ci.org/neuropoly/spinalcordtoolbox>`__
hasn't succeeded. If you are familiar with it, consult the test results
to fix the problem.

Reviewers
~~~~~~~~~

Any changes submitted for inclusion to the master branch will have to go
through a
`review <https://help.github.com/articles/about-pull-request-reviews/>`__.

Only request a review when you deem the PR as "good to go". If the PR is
not ready for review, convert it to a "Draft".

Github may suggest you to add particular reviewers to your PR. If that's
the case and you don't know better, add all of these suggestions. The
reviewers will be notified when you add them.

Versioning
----------

Versioning uses the following convention: MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH, where:

PATCH version when there are backwards-compatible bug fixes or
enhancements, without alteration to Python's modules or data/binaries.
MINOR version when there are minor API changes or new functionality in a
backwards-compatible manner, or when there are alteration to Python's
modules or data/binaries (which requires to re-run installer for people
working on the dev version), MAJOR version when there are major
incompatible API changes, Beta releases follow the following convention:

MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH-beta.x (with x = 0, 1, 2, etc.) Stable version is
indicated in the file version.txt. For development version (on master),
the version is "dev".

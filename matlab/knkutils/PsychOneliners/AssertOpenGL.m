function AssertOpenGL
% AssertOpenGL
%
% Break and issue an eror message if the installed Psychtoolbox is not
% based on OpenGL or Screen() is not working properly.
% To date there are four versions of the Psychtoolbox, each based on a
% different graphics library:
%
%  OS9: Psychtoolbox-2, based on Apple's QuickDraw.
%  Win: Psychtoolbox-2, based on Direct X and GDI.
%  Win: OpenGL for the ported OSX-Psychtoolbox, aka Psychtoolbox-3.
%  OSX: OpenGL for Psychtoolbox-3.
%  Linux: OpenGL for Psychtoolbox-3.
%
%  The Psychtoolboxes based on OpenGL are partially incompatible (see below)
%  with previous Psychtoolboxes.  A script which relies on the OpenGL
%  Psychtoolbox should call AssertOpenGL so that it will issue the
%  appropriate warning if a user tries to run it on a computer with a
%  non-OpenGL based Psychtoolbox installed.
%
%  OpenGL-based Psychtoolboxes are distinguised by the availability of these
%  functions:
%
%   Screen('Flip',...);
%   Screen('MakeTexture');
%   Screen('DrawTexture');
%
%
%  If you know you're using Psychtoolbox-3, then the most likely cause for
%  this error message is a problem in the configuration of your
%  Matlab/Octave + System setup, or in the Psychtoolbox installation.
%
%  Typically either the Screen MEX file can't be found or accessed, due to
%  some wrong Matlab/Octave path (Proper Screen file not in path), or due
%  to some permission issue (insufficient security access permissions -
%  typically found on MS-Windows systems), or the Screen MEX file can't be
%  loaded and initialized due to some missing or wrong system library on
%  your machine, e.g., the C runtime library is of an incompatible type.
%  Simply type the command "Screen" at the prompt to see if this may be an
%  issue.
%
%  In both cases, indicated by some "file not found" or "file could not by
%  accesses" or "invalid MEX file" error message, you may want to run the
%  SetupPsychtoolbox command again. This will either fix the problem for
%  you by reconfiguring Psychtoolbox, or it will provide more diagnostic
%  error and troubleshooting messages. Make also sure that you read the
%  troubleshooting tips in the "Download" and "Frequently asked questions"
%  sections of our Psychtoolbox Wiki at http://www.psychtoolbox.org

% HISTORY
% 7/10/04   awi     wrote it.
% 7/13/04   awi     Fixed documentation.
% 10/6/05   awi	    Note here cosmetic changes by dgp between 7/13/04 and 10/6/05
% 12/31/05  mk      Detection code modified to really query type of Screen command (OpenGL?)
%                   instead of OS type, as PTB-OpenGL is now available for Windows as well.
% 06/05/08  mk      Hopefully more diagnostic output message added.
% 05/25/11  mk      Update linker failure message on Octave+Windows: Don't
%                   need ARVideo libraries anymore, but instead the
%                   GStreamer runtime.
% 03/24/12  mk      Add do_braindead_shortcircuit_evaluation() to avoid
%                   warnings on Octave 3.6 and later.
% 09/05/12  mk      Disable shortcircuit operator warning.
% 05/13/13  mk      Reenable short-circuit-operator warnings for Octave, as
%                   they shouldn't be needed anymore with our fixed M-Files.

% Ok, we sneak this in here, because we don't know a better place for it:
% Disable this workaround for now. All M-Files presumably have been fixed,
% so no need for it. Leave disabled code here in case we overlooked something.
% if IsOctave
%     % If we're running on a Octave version which supports this...
%     if exist('do_braindead_shortcircuit_evaluation', 'builtin')
%         % ... we enable Matlab-style short-circuit operator evaluation,
%         % ie., treat & and | operators as if they are && and || operators,
%         % if they are used in if and while statements and the conditions do
%         % evaluate into logical expressions with a simple scalar truth
%         % value.
%         %
%         % This is a hack to silence interpreter warnings and get compatible
%         % behaviour. A better fix would be to fix all our M-Files to avoid
%         % use of & and |, but this would make ptb completely untestable on
%         % Matlab versions prior R2007a for MK. As long as we claim to
%         % support pre-R2007a at least to some degree, we should be able to
%         % run at least some basic correctness tests:
%         do_braindead_shortcircuit_evaluation(1);
% 
%         % Disable associated Octave warning:
%         warning('off', 'Octave:possible-matlab-short-circuit-operator');
%     end
% end

% We put the detection code into a try-catch-end statement: The old Screen command on windows
% doesn't have a 'Version' subfunction, so it would exit to Matlab with an error.
% We catch this error in the catch-branch and output the "non-OpenGL" error message...
try
   % Query a Screen subfunction that only exists in the new Screen command If this is not
   % OpenGL PTB,we will get thrown into the catch-branch...

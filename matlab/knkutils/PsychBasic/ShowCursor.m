function oldType = ShowCursor(type, screenid, mouseid)
% oldType = ShowCursor([type] [, screenid][, mouseid])
%
% ShowCursor redisplays the mouse pointer after a previous call to
% HideCursor. If the optional 'type' is specified, it also allows to alter
% the shape of the cursor. See following sections for details.
%
% The optional 'mouseid' allows to select which mouse cursor shall
% be redisplayed or changed in visual appearance. This only makes sense
% if you have multiple visible mouse cursors and is currently a Linux only
% feature.
%
% The return value 'oldType' is always zero, as this query mechanism is not
% supported with PTB-3. Just returned for backwards-compatibility.
% 
% OSX, WINDOWS, LINUX: ___________________________________________________
%
% Cursor shape can be selected. Four types are defined by name:
%
% 'Arrow' = Standard mouse-pointer arrow.
% 'CrossHair' = A cross-hair cursor.
% 'Hand' = A hand symbol.
% 'SandClock' = Some sort of sand clock/hour-glass (not available on 64-Bit OSX).
%
%  Apart from that names, you can pass integral numbers for type to select
%  further shapes. The mapping of numbers to shapes is operating system
%  dependent, therefore not portable across different platforms. On
%  MS-Windows, you can select between number 0 to 7. On Linux/X11 you can
%  select from a wide range of numbers from 0 up to (at least) 152, maybe
%  more, depending on your setup. See the C header file "X11/cursorfont.h"
%  for a mapping of numbers to shapes. Passing invalid numbers can create
%  errors. On 32-Bit OS/X, numbers between zero and 17 are currently valid.
%  You can find a list of mappings from type to number for 32-Bit OS/X at:
%  http://developer.apple.com/documentation/macos8/HumanInterfaceToolbox/Ap
%  pManager/ProgWithAppearanceMgr/Appearance.9d.html#10244
%
% LINUX: ___________________________________________________________________ 
%
% Linux allows for display and handling of multiple mouse cursors if your
% X-Server is of version 1.7 or later.
%
% If provided, the optional "type" argument changes the cursor shape to:
%   0: Arrow
%   1: I Beam
%   2: Cross
%   3: Plus
%   4: Watch
%   5: Arrow
% 128: P
% 300: Beachball 1/4
% 301: Beachball 2/4
% 302: Beachball 3/4
% 303: Beachball 4/4
% 400: fat arrow
% 401: fat I Beam
% Type 0 (and 5 for backward compatibility) is predefined as the standard 
% arrow cursor. The rest return whatever Apple's GetCursor(type) finds in
% the  System or Matlab's resource forks. If nothing is found, the type is
% reset to 0. The fat arrow and I beam are copied from the "Fat Cursors v
% 1.2" control panel created by Robert Abatecola, 5106 Forest Glen Drive,
% San Jose, CA 95129.

   Easily implemented. Beautiful output of state-of-the-art results

   We use SCT for all our spinal cord analysis in studies of Multiple Sclerosis 
   as well as Spinal Cord Injury and ataxia. I also used SCT in the first study 
   of SC involvement in dementia.

   The Spinal Cord Toolbox is an excellent (free and open-source) resource for
   anybody interested in conducting spinal cord research. I am currently using 
   it for multiple projects, and plan to continue using it in the future. The 
   community forum has been particularly helpful because my questions have been 
   addressed in a timely fashion - and have resulted in quick bug fixes and 
   additional features. Funding agencies interested in supporting collaborative 
   and reproducible research may view the Spinal Cord Toolbox as worthwhile 
   investment.

   SCT is an invaluable tool for our investigations of central pain processing 
   in the spinal cord using fMRI. In addition, our combined cortico-spinal 
   imaging approach greatly benefits from the accurate spatial prepossessing 
   capabilities of the SCT.

Note to developers: I'm sure we can find a way to remove the "!" at the top of each admonition.

   Easily implemented. Beautiful output of state-of-the-art results


.. admonition:: Claudia Gandini Wheeler-Kingshott, PhD, *NMR Research Unit, UCL*, London ðŸ‡¬ðŸ‡§

   We use SCT for all our spinal cord analysis in studies of Multiple Sclerosis 
   as well as Spinal Cord Injury and ataxia. I also used SCT in the first study 
   of SC involvement in dementia.


.. admonition:: Robert Barry, PhD, *Harvard/MGH*, Boston ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸

   The Spinal Cord Toolbox is an excellent (free and open-source) resource for
   anybody interested in conducting spinal cord research. I am currently using 
   it for multiple projects, and plan to continue using it in the future. The 
   community forum has been particularly helpful because my questions have been 
   addressed in a timely fashion - and have resulted in quick bug fixes and 
   additional features. Funding agencies interested in supporting collaborative 
   and reproducible research may view the Spinal Cord Toolbox as worthwhile 
   investment.


.. admonition:: Christian BÃ¼chel, MD, *Department for Systems Neuroscience* ðŸ‡©ðŸ‡ª

   SCT is an invaluable tool for our investigations of central pain processing 
   in the spinal cord using fMRI. In addition, our combined cortico-spinal 
   imaging approach greatly benefits from the accurate spatial prepossessing 
   capabilities of the SCT.

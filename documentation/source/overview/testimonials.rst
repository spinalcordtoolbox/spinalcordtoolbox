   :class: testimonial

   The Spinal Cord Toolbox is an excellent (free and open-source) resource for
   anybody interested in conducting spinal cord research. I am currently using
   it for multiple projects, and plan to continue using it in the future. The
   community forum has been particularly helpful because my questions have been
   addressed in a timely fashion - and have resulted in quick bug fixes and
   additional features. Funding agencies interested in supporting collaborative
   and reproducible research may view the Spinal Cord Toolbox as worthwhile
   investment.

   :class: testimonial

   I have been working on spinal cord MRI for some years and I cannot make it
   without help of SCT. The segmentation, co-registration and MNI template etc
   are great features in the SCT toolbox, fast and reliable. We have published
   papers in high impact journals such as PNAS and Brain, using SCT as the main
   analysis tool. SCT is well documented and the forum is really helpful as
   well. We can always get very quick replies for any questions there! So huge
   thanks to the SCT team for their hard work and contribution to spinal cord
   imaging research.

   :class: testimonial

   SCT is a powerful tool to process and analyze spinal cord MRI with minimal
   manual procedures. It's been actively developed and maintained.


.. admonition:: Kouhei Kamiya, MD, PhD | Toho University | Tokyo ðŸ‡¯ðŸ‡µ
   :class: testimonial

   I use SCT basically for segmentation and quantitative measurement of spinal
   cord MRI for my research, including some on-going works. SCT is well
   documented, and instruction at the website as well as the workshop helped me a
   lot. The best thing I like about SCT is that it is user-friendly and the
   results are easy to use for publication in papers.


.. admonition:: Jonathan Brooks, PhD | University of East Anglia | Norwich ðŸ‡¬ðŸ‡§
   :class: testimonial

   Honestly, as one of the original developers of spinal functional imaging, I
   think this field would not have thrived as much as it has without the
   developments that Julien and his co-workers have given the community. They
   have applied cutting edge techniques and robust validation pipelines to
   ensure that researchers can (hopefully) say sensible things about their
   data. In particular, the spatial normalisation of spinal imaging data across
   individuals is a major achievement, without which we'd still be floundering
   in the dark. The team have put on a variety of free seminars (and webinars)
   across the globe to help users get up to speed, and are always incredibly
   responsive when contacted via online forums. Not much else to say other than
   "Bravo!".


.. admonition:: Marco Loggia, PhD | MGH, Harvard Med School | Boston ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸
   :class: testimonial

   Over the last few years, our lab has been using SCT mostly to perform spinal
   cord PET imaging. This tool has enabled us to perform, automatically and
   very easily, image analyses that would be otherwise extremely laborious.
   Even more impressive is how responsive Julien and his team. We love this
   tool!


.. admonition:: David Cadotte, MD, PhD | University of Calgary | Calgary ðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡¦
   :class: testimonial

   At the University of Calgary we are using SCT to process both routine
   clinical MRI scans (commonly used to confirm a diagnosis of degenerative
   cervical myelopathy) and advanced imaging protocols of diffusion imaging,
   magnetization transfer imaging and t2* acquisitions of the human spinal cord
   in states of both 'health' and disease. We are incorporating the derived
   metrics into prediction algorithms to help patients understand their spinal
   cord condition and make informed decisions about treatment options.  The SCT
   is very well documented but the community forum and development team are an
   incredible asset to aid in the successful implementation of the tools
   available within the SCT.  Congratulations to Professor Cohen-Adad and his
   incredible team for making this project a success that is resonating with
   patients across the country!


.. admonition:: Francesco Grussu, PhD | Vall d'Hebron Institute of Oncology | Barcelona ðŸ‡ªðŸ‡¸
   :class: testimonial

   I am a user of SCT since its first release. My work has so far focussed on
   advanced spinal cord MRI (mainly diffusion MRI), and when I approached this
   field there were no well-established tools to process spinal cord MRI data
   yet (2012). However, since its first release back in 2015ish-2016ish, SCT
   has really changed how we work in spinal cord MRI: the toolbox has equipped
   MRI physicists and radiologists with an interest in spinal cord with a
   powerful set of tools to deal with all standard (yet, extremely important)
   preprocessing. I have published 2 papers as a first author using SCT, and I
   have co-authored more. I cannot think of working on spinal cord MRI without
   relying on such a well-documented toolbox - which, least but not last, works
   extremely well, and is managed by a fantastic team who replies within
   minutes to any question one may have. To conclude, the SCT is a fantastic
   tool for the spinal cord MRI community, and as a spinal cord MRI scientist I
   am really thankful to the team for having made my life so much easier.


.. admonition:: Haykel Snoussi, PhD | Data and Imaging Analyst, UT Health San Antonio, Texas | ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸
   :class: testimonial

   I used SCT during my PhD for the process of Diffusion MRI data of spinal
   cord in the context of multiple sclerosis disease. Using this toolbox, I was
   able to publish two conferences papers.


.. admonition:: Marios Yiannakas, PhD | University College London (UCL) | London ðŸ‡¬ðŸ‡§
   :class: testimonial

   SCT facilitates research into spinal cord imaging in no other known
   reliable, respected, and cost-free alternative currently available.
   Genuinely grateful for the effort behind this, and the vision altogether,
   super thankful, and fully supportive of the maintenance of it, without a
   doubt.


.. admonition:: Satoshi Maki MD, PhD | Chiba University | Chiba ðŸ‡¯ðŸ‡µ
   :class: testimonial

   SCT made a breakthrough enabling the quantification of spinal cord MRI in a
   modern way. It also has helpful community forum even for newbies.


.. admonition:: Maria Marcella Lagana, PhD | IRCCS Fondazione Don Carlo Gnocchi ONLUS | Milan ðŸ‡®ðŸ‡¹
   :class: testimonial

   I use SCT for quantifying the spinal cord cross-sectional area and the
   spinal cord diffusion properties in a study of subjects with Multiple
   Sclerosis.  The SCT documents, courses, and recordings have been very useful
   for learning how to use the software and for knowing its updates. The
   interactions with the forum are prompt and useful for any doubts.  The past
   SCT workshops have also been useful to write consensus guidelines about
   quantitative spinal cord MRI acquisition and processing.


.. admonition:: Ben Davies MD, MPhil | University of Cambridge | Cambridge ðŸ‡¬ðŸ‡§
   :class: testimonial

   Degenerative Cervical Myelopathy - Clinical Research. New to the platform,
   but ongoing study exploring its value as a radiological endpoints for the
   disease. I attended one of the SCT courses in London. I think
   fundamentally this is an incredible resource, easy to use even for a
   clinician with limited prior experience, and is enabling access to
   quantitative MRI of the spinal cord, which is incredibly under utilised in a
   wide range of diseases. The team, led by JCA are incredibly supportive,
   able to answer emails and share the science which underpins and drives the
   platform forward.


.. admonition:: Karina Robles, BSc | National Autonomous University of Mexico | Mexico City ðŸ‡²ðŸ‡½
   :class: testimonial

   I'm using SCT for fMRI of patients who had an Cerebral Vascular Event. I've
   never posted on the forum, but other questions have helped me to understand
   the questions I have. I like SCT because is a friendly toolbox for
   processing cervical image data.


.. admonition:: Maxime Descoteaux, PhD | UniversitÃ© de Sherbrooke | Sherbrooke ðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡¦
   :class: testimonial

   User-friendly, clear documentation, large community, rapid release, can be

   :class: testimonial

   SCT has sped up our spinal cord research in multiple sclerosis. We are
   now processing spinal cord images from clinical trials and practice.


.. admonition:: Sergio Daniel Hernandez Charpak, MSc | EPFL | Lausanne ðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡­
   :class: testimonial

   I am using SCT in a fMRI context. I have used it in different steps, as
   segmentation of the CSF and spinal cord in the lumbar region, or to perform
   motion correction. This has been a challenge and we are at the border of the
   technically feasible. SCT has been crucial in making it possible. The
   documentation and the community forum are world class. Every time I have
   used them (the forum, the git, or simply the documentation), I have been
   amazed by the response time and quality of the responses. It is definitively
   an example of open source project bringing scientists together to push the
   boundaries of knowledge.


.. admonition:: Patrick Freund, MD, PhD | University of Zurich | Zurich ðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡­
   :class: testimonial

   We use the SCT for tissue-specific segmentation and preprocessing of spinal
   cord fRMI data.


.. admonition:: Emil Ljungberg, PhD | King's College London | London ðŸ‡¬ðŸ‡§
   :class: testimonial

   I was an early adopter of the spinal cord toolbox and started using it in
   2015 for doing basic segmentation of the spinal cord. It later became
   instrumental in my MSc project for quantitative myelin water imaging. What
   makes SCT really great is the community, including an active online forum
   and workshops around ISMRM. The SCT team also publish great articles about
   the techniques which are essential references when using the tools in
   publications.


.. admonition:: Rosella Tro', PhD | University of Genoa | Genova ðŸ‡®ðŸ‡¹
   :class: testimonial

   My experience with SCT concerns computation of Diffusion Kurtosis Imaging
   measures on neonatal subjects in the spinal cord district. Specifically,
   through the constant support of SCT community members, I was able to
   implement an analysis pipeline from image acquisition to computation of
   metrics through registration with atlas. All steps were adapted for neonatal
   age range from the default adult ones. This pipeline has then been applied
   to a pilot case study. I really appreciate this open-source, user-friendly
   software as well as availability of its creators for any question or issue.


.. admonition:: Jon Stutters, BEng | UCL | London ðŸ‡¬ðŸ‡§
   :class: testimonial

   We use SCT for investigations into spinal cord injury and multiple
   sclerosis. Analysis using SCT has contributed to several MS clinical trials
   in which we are involved. I find SCT to be well documented and each of its
   tools has a clear purpose. I also appreciate that it is made available
   under an open license.


.. admonition:: Romina Mariano, MD, PhD | University of Oxford | Oxford ðŸ‡¬ðŸ‡§
   :class: testimonial

   My research focus is spinal cord involvement in neuro-inflammatory
   conditions of the central nervous system. SCT is an invaluable resource for
   spinal cord imaging. SCT is well documented but additionally the workshops
   and online community forum are useful for added support. My research has
   also shown that SCT is useful for clinical research with potential for
   direct clinical applicability in the future. The spinal cord is
   under-studied due to the difficulty experienced in cord imaging and analysis
   but with tools such as SCT we will make great strides in our understanding
   of important neurological conditions and symptoms that will have a
   significant impact for academia but also for the quality of life of our
   patients.


.. admonition:: Mohammed Khamaysa, MD, PhD student | Sorbonne university, INSERM | Paris ðŸ‡«ðŸ‡·
   :class: testimonial

   I am using SCT for treating MRIs at spinal levels in ALS patients; including
   structural images and DTI to obtain quantitative metrics. I have been using
   SCT for 2 years, and I have found it easy to use with minimal knowledge on imaging
   processing. It would be helpful to have more example data with the ways to
   analyze them. Thank you so much for providing this powerful tool.


.. admonition:: Alicia Cronin | Robarts Research Institute | London ðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡¦
   :class: testimonial

   Currently, we use SCT to segment the spinal cords of Degenerative Cervical
   Myelopathy patients. We have used SCT in our study to quantify spinal cord
   compression in these patients. When first starting with SCT, I attended the
   Spinal Cord Workshop, which was very helpful for setting up the program and
   the basic functions. Any other problems I have encountered have been well
   documented in the posted tutorials and forum online. It is very easy to use
   and there is plenty of help online.


.. admonition:: Nawal Kinany, PhD | University of Geneva | Geneva ðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡­
   :class: testimonial

   Great toolbox, that I have, so far, mostly used to process spinal cord fMRI
   data. The SCT offers powerful tools to bring this field forward and to
   enable more uniform & robust analyses (segmentation, normalization to a
   common template, etc.). The toolbox is well documented, with useful
   workshops and a very responsive team. Thanks for that!


.. admonition:: Ibrahim Hattan, MD, PhD | University of Queensland | ðŸ‡¦ðŸ‡º
   :class: testimonial

   I'm using SCT to analyze ex vivo human spinal cord data. There are a huge
   progress in my analysis using the amazing features in term of segmentation,
   registration, etc. The SCT is well documented and there are much work from
   its team by recorded courses (available publicly) for users from all over
   the world. Personally, I've received valuable assistance and useful feedback
   from the SCT community. Also, the SCT team helped me to generate a specific
   deep learning model and implemented in SCT software (to benefit other users)
   in order to segment our ex-vivo tissues. I'm extremely grateful to all SCT
   community for their help, support, effort and wish this community the best
   in their future work and development.


.. admonition:: Mahdi Alizadeh, PhD | Thomas Jefferson University | Philadelphia ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸
   :class: testimonial

   I used SCT for diffusion processing of spinal cord. Software itself was well
   documented for me.


.. admonition:: Shiva Shahrampour, MSc | Thomas Jefferson University | Philadelphia ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸
   :class: testimonial

   My major line of work is pediatric spinal cord imaging analysis. I have been
   using SCT as the major tool for my analysis and have been very satisfied
   with the result. The toolbox provides comprehensive and robust tools for the
   spinal cord segmentation of multimodal images, spinal cord registration,
   atlas based analysis of white matter tracts and many other useful
   applications. SCT has saved me from going back and forth between several
   applications while working on our dataset. The community forum is absolutely
   helpful and responsive when there's an issue with the dataset or analysis.
   They do take the time to make sure they address the questions in a timely
   manner. Bottom line, I am glad SCT exists and I highly recommend it. Kudos
   to SCT dev team!


.. admonition:: Merve Kaptan, MSc | Max Planck Institute for Human Cognitive and Brain Sciences | Leipzig ðŸ‡©ðŸ‡ª
   :class: testimonial

   As a PhD student who did not work with spinal cord fMRI data before, I found
   SCT very very helpful. It is very nice to have a dedicated toolbox with
   functions tailored to spinal cord acquisitions. Currently, I am working on a
   project in which we used the automated segmentation functionality of the SCT
   to automate a procedure and this was very helpful! Also Dr. Cohen-Adad and
   other SCT experts are very helpful and quick to reply if one encounters
   problems. I cannot recommend it enough. :)


.. admonition:: Abdullah Althobity, MD, PhD candidate | Ministry of Education | Riyadh ðŸ‡¸ðŸ‡¦
   :class: testimonial

   I used SCT for to segment lumbar spinal cord region of EAE mouse model of
   multiple sclerosis. The model has been trained very well by Charley and
   Julien after I sent them some samples. They helped me from installing the
   software to the final step. Then all my data, which is over 70 mice, have
   been easy to analyse without any error. The biggest advantage of SCT that I
   or any colleague can run any segmentation in consistent way. The forum is
   very useful where I get all answers for any question in very quick way.


.. admonition:: Arash Forodighasemabadi, MSc | Aix-Marseille University | ðŸ‡«ðŸ‡·
   :class: testimonial

   I use SCT on a daily basis, since my project is related to the microtrauma
   of cervical spinal cord. I am satisfied with SCT and its documentation and
   help. I rarely visit the community forum, since I have not yet encountered
   big problems and errors (that I cannot find solutions to in the help).

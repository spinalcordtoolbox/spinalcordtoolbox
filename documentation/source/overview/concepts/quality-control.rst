Quality Control
***************

Some SCT tools can generate Quality Control (QC) reports.
These reports consist in "appendable" HTML files, containing a table
of entries and allowing to show, for each entry, animated images
(background with overlay on and off).

To generate a QC report, add the `-qc` command-line argument,
with the location (folder, to be created by the SCT tool),
where the QC files should be generated.

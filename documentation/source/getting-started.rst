Getting Started
###############


To get started using SCT, you may take a look at the `Batch Processing
Example`_, or follow the longer `Course`_ materials.

Batch Processing Example
************************

SCT includes a `batch_processing <https://github.com/neuropoly/spinalcordtoolbox/blob/master/batch_processing.sh>`_
script that will get you started with basic analyses.

Executing the script will download example data which can be used for
training purposes:

.. code:: sh

   $ ~/sct_*/batch_processing.sh

The script source is reasonably documented:

.. literalinclude:: ../../../batch_processing.sh
   :language: sh


Course

See the latest course materials `here <https://osf.io/fvnjq/>`_.

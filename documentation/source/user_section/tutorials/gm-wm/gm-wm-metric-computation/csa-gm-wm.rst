Using binary masks to compute CSA for gray and white matter
###########################################################

The computed GM and WM segmentations can be used to compute the cross sectional area of GM and WM. This is achieved using ``sct_process_segmentation``.

.. code::

   sct_process_segmentation -i t2s_wmseg.nii.gz -o csa_wm.csv -angle-corr 0 -perslice 1

.. code::

   sct_process_segmentation -i t2s_gmseg.nii.gz -o csa_gm.csv -angle-corr 0 -perslice 1

:Input arguments:
   - ``-i`` : The input segmentation file.
   - ``-o`` : The output CSV file.
   - ``-angle-corr 0``: Normally, angle correction will be applied during ``sct_process_segmentation`` to account for scans where the spinal cord is positioned at an angle with respect to the superior-inferior axis. While this works well when the input is a full spinal cord segmentation, in this case we are instead providing GM/WM segmentations only. The shape of these segmentations can have a negative effect on so the estimation of the cord centerline, which in turn may cause the estimated angle to be incorrect. So, here we specify ``0`` to turn off angle correction.
   - **Note:** Turning off angle correction is only safe to do if you know that your axial slices were acquired roughly orthogonal to the cord.
   - ``-perslice`` : Set this option to 1 to turn on per-slice computation.

:Output files/folders:
   - ``csa_wm.csv`` and ``csa_gm.csv``: Two CSV files containing shape metrics for both the white and gray matter segmentations.

   comment:: The SCT course has a "New and Upcoming Features" section that is
             used primarily for advertising at the end of the course. That
             section is mostly ephemeral; whenever we start a new course, we
             take the previous "New" features and incorporate them into the
             main sections of the course and web tutorials. So, I don't think
             that we need to specifically add a "New and Upcoming Features" to
             the web tutorials.

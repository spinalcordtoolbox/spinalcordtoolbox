Before starting this tutorial
#############################

1. Read through the following page to familiarize yourself with key SCT concepts:

    * :ref:`inspecting-your-results`: After some steps in this tutorial, instructions are provided to open the output images using :ref:`Quality Control (QC) <qc>` reports and :ref:`fsleyes-instructions`.

2. Make sure that you have the following files in your working directory:

   * ``single_subject/data/mt/mt1.nii.gz`` : The magnetization transfer image with the off-resonance RF pulse applied.
   * ``single_subject/data/t2/warp_template2anat.nii.gz`` : The warping field that defines the transformation from the PAM50 template to the T2 anatomical space.

   You can get these files by downloading :sct_tutorial_data:`data_coregistration.zip`.

.. note:: If you are :ref:`completing all of SCT's tutorials in sequence <completing-the-tutorials-in-sequence>`, your working directory should already contain the files needed for this tutorial.

3. Open a terminal and navigate to the ``single_subject/data/mt/`` directory:

.. code:: sh

   cd {PATH_TO_DOWNLOADED_DATA}/single_subject/data/mt/

Before starting this tutorial
#############################

1. Some of the steps in this tutorial rely on the results of a previous registration procedure, so you may need to first complete :ref:`template-registration`, which ensures that the following file is present:

   * ``/t2/warp_template2anat.nii.gz`` : The warping field that defines the transformation from the PAM50 template to the anatomical space.

2. Open a terminal and navigate to the ``sct_course_london20/single_subject/data/mt/`` directory.

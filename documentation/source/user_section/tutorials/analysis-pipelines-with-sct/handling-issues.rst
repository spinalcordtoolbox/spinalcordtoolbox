What if things go wrong?

If you spot any issues during QC, e.g., error during segmentation, you can correct the issue (manually or by adjusting SCT parameters), and then re-run the processing.

Manual corrections
==================

SCT provides a downloadable script called ``manual_correction.py`` that can be used to conveniently correct any segmentations with issues (i.e. the subjects that were marked with "Fail" during :ref:`the previous QC step <batch-qc_report>`).

Setting up the environment
--------------------------

As a prerequisite, make sure you have an image viewer installed (in this case: FSLeyes):

.. code:: sh

    # Next, make sure that your image viewer is callable from the
    # Terminal. In the course we use FSLeyes but you can do the same
    # with another viewer (eg: ITKsnap).
    fsleyes --version

Next, download the manual correction script and check its options:

.. code:: sh

    # First, download the manual correction script into a folder called `manual-correction`
    sct_download_data -d manual-correction -o manual-correction

    # Then you can look at the files in the folder
    ls manual-correction

    # Make sure to access the version of Python inside the SCT installation
    sct_python="$SCT_DIR/python/envs/venv_sct/bin/python"

    # Now we can check the options of the manual correction script (using the help flag -h)
    $sct_python manual-correction/manual_correction.py -h

.. note::

    By typing ``$SCT_DIR/python/envs/venv_sct/bin/python`` instead of just ``python``, we can directly access the version of Python that lives inside the SCT installation. This is useful because the ``manual-correction.py`` script depends on packages that are installed with SCT, but that may not be installed in your default Python environment.

Running the correction script
-----------------------------

Once your setup is ready, you can run the manual correction script.

.. code:: sh

    # Run the manual correction script
    $sct_python manual-correction/manual_correction.py -config qc_fail.yml -path-img output/data_processed/ -path-out data/derivatives/labels
    # Check the files output to the ‘derivatives/’ folder
    tree data/derivatives

:Input arguments:
   - ``-config``: A YAML file containing a list of files. Here, we supply ``qc_fail.yml``, which can be generated by marking subjects in a QC report, then clicking the "Export Fails" button. (Note: We provide a sample ``qc_fail.yml`` for you, so this file should already be present in the working directory.)
   - ``-path-image`` : The path to the parent folder containing the images to be corrected.
   - ``-path-out`` : The path to the parent folder where corrected images should be outputted to.

:Output files/folders:
   - The output segmentations will be organized into subject-specific subfolders according to BIDS convention.
   - JSON sidecar files will be created with first and last name (entered at runtime) and date, for traceability.

Re-run analysis (with corrections)
==================================

``process_data.sh`` contains a number of convenience functions that will prioritize any file with suffix ``-manual`` (if it exists) and use that file instead of re-computing the segmentation. That way, you can manually process outlier subjects without interrupting the automated processing for the dataset as a whole.

.. code:: sh

    sct_run_batch -script process_data.sh -path-data data/ -path-output output_correction -jobs 3

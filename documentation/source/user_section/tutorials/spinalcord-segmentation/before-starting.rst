    * :ref:`inspecting-your-results`: After some steps in this tutorial, instructions are provided to open the output images using :ref:`Quality Control (QC) <qc>` reports and :ref:`fsleyes-instructions`.

2. Make sure that you have the following files in your working directory:

   * ``single_subject/data/t1/t1.nii.gz``: An anatomical spinal cord scan in the T1 contrast.
   * ``single_subject/data/t2/t2.nii.gz``: An anatomical spinal cord scan in the T2 contrast.

   You can get these files by downloading :sct_tutorial_data:`data_template-registration.zip`.

.. note:: If you are :ref:`completing all of SCT's tutorials in sequence <completing-the-tutorials-in-sequence>`, your working directory should already contain the files needed for this tutorial.

Other shape metrics
###################

The csv files generated by ``sct_process_segmentation`` also include metrics to analyse the shape of the spinal cord in the axial plane, such as ellipticity, antero-posterior and right-left dimensions. These are of particular interest for studying cord compression. See `Martin et al. BMJ Open 2018 <https://bmjopen.bmj.com/content/8/4/e019809>`_ for an example application in degenerative cervical myelopathy.

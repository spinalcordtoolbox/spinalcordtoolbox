Verifying the correctness of the metrics
****************************************

You may have noticed that the csv files generated by ``sct_process_segmentation`` also include the angles between the cord centerline and the normal to the axial plane. Angle_AP corresponds to the angle about the AP axis, while angle_RL corresponds to the angle about the RL axis. These angles are used to correct for the tilt of the spinal cord relative to the superior-inferior axis. Therefore, if you obtain inconsistent CSA values, it is a good habit to verify that the values of these angles are reasonable.

To demonstrate, below are the shape metrics for the CSV file produced in :ref:`csa-perlevel`.

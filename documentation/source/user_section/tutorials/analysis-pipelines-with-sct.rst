Processing batches of subjects using pipeline scripts
#####################################################

The tutorials provided so far have focused on analyzing a single subject at a time. If you have a large dataset, however, running terminal commands for each subject could be a labor-intensive, time-consuming process.

To address this, SCT provides a tool called ``sct_run_batch`` to run processing pipelines across multi-subject datasets. This tutorial provides a brief overview of how to use this tool on an example dataset.

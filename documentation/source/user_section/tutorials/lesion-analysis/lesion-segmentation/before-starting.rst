#. Make sure that you have the following files in your working directory:

   * ``single_subject/data/t2_lesion/t2.nii.gz``: A T2w anatomical image with fake lesion (because of the difficulty to share patient data).

   You can get these files by downloading `data_lesion.zip <https://github.com/spinalcordtoolbox/sct_tutorial_data/archive/refs/heads/master.zip>`_.

#. Open a terminal and navigate to the ``single_subject/data/t2_lesion/`` directory:

.. code:: sh

   cd {PATH_TO_DOWNLOADED_DATA}/single_subject/data/t2_lesion/

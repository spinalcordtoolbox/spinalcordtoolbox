``sct_deepseg``: Other specialized models
#########################################

The :ref:`sct_deepseg` script also provides access to specialized models that focus on tasks outside of basic spinal cord segmentation. In recent versions, new models for the segmentation of spinal tumors, human multi-class SC & GM at 7T, MS lesion segmentation on MP2RAGE, mouse SC, etc. have been added.

   Sample models. (**Tumor segmentation**: `Lemay et al. NeuroImage Clinical (2021) <https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34352654/>`__,
   **WM/GM cord segmentation at 7T**: `Laines Medina et al. arXiv (2021) <https://arxiv.org/pdf/2110.06516.pdf>`__,
   **MP2RAGE SC and lesion segmentation**: `Cohen-Adad et al. Zenodo release (2023) <https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.8376754>`__)

You can learn more about all of the available models by:

* Running :ref:`sct_deepseg` ``-h`` to view a basic summary
* Running :ref:`sct_deepseg` ``-task-details`` to view detailed descriptions of each model.
* Visiting the visual gallery of models by going to the :ref:`sct_deepseg` page.

Before starting this tutorial
#############################

This compression analysis tutorial is separate from the previous segmentation, labeling, and shape analysis tutorials, meaning it can be run standalone.

#. Make sure that you have the following files in your working directory:

   * ``single_subject/data/t2_compression/t2_compression.nii.gz``: A 3D binary mask for the spinal cord of a T2w anatomical image with spinal cord compression.

   You can get these files by downloading :sct_tutorial_data:`data_compression.zip`.

#. Open a terminal and navigate to the ``single_subject/data/t2_compression/`` directory:

.. code:: sh

   cd {PATH_TO_DOWNLOADED_DATA}/single_subject/data/t2_compression/

Coregistering additional data (MT, DTI) to the PAM50 template
#############################################################

This tutorial demonstrates how to register images of other types (MT, DTI). This is especially useful if you wish to coregister multiple contrasts acquired in the same session. In this tutorial, we will work with magnetization transfer imaging (MTI) data, but these steps should apply to any images that are similar in appearance to T1, T2, or T2* contrasts.

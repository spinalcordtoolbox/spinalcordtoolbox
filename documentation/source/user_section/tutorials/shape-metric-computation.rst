This section demonstrates how to compute shape metrics of the spinal cord using the ``sct_process_segmentation`` command. Of primary interest is the cross-sectional area (CSA) of the spinal cord, but this command will also calculate other shape metrics, such as diameter, orientation, and symmetry of the cord.

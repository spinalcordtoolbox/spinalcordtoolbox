Gray matter segmentation
########################

This tutorial is an in-depth, multistep guide to segmenting the gray and white matter from your data, then using the segmentation to improve registrations for other contrasts (e.g. T2, MT). Because of this, it is intended to act as an extension of the previous :doc:`Registration to template <registration-to-template>` tutorial.

Each individual tutorial below is linked together as part of an overarching analysis pipeline, so we recommend that you follow each tutorial in sequence.

.. TODO:

   Is this one-page tutorial necessary? It is basically just telling users that the ``sct_smooth_spinalcord`` tool exists. (Compared to other tutorials, which demonstrate multi-step workflows.)

   So, I am thinking that maybe this page will be unnecessary once we organize the "Command-Line Tools" page into one-page-per-script. We could simply have all of this information on the dedicated "sct_smooth_spinalcord" page instead, and save the "Tutorials" for complex workflows only.

.. _spinalcord-smoothing:

Spinal cord smoothing as a preprocessing operation
##################################################

SCT provides a spinal cord smoothing function that takes into account the curvature of the cord, preserving the boundary between the spinal cord and cerebrospinal fluid. This is useful in a variety of situations:

* It can be used to improve sensitivity of fMRI results while minimizing contamination from CSF
* It can also be used to obtain more reliable cord segmentations, because smoothing will sharpen the edge of the cord and will blur out possible artifacts at the cord/CSF interface.

Downloading the files for this tutorial
---------------------------------------

First, make sure that you have the following files in your working directory:

* ``single_subject/data/t1.nii.gz``: The image without the magnetization transfer pulse.
* ``single_subject/data/t1_seg.nii.gz``: The image with the magnetization transfer pulse.

  You can get these files by downloading :sct_tutorial_data:`data_spinalcord-smoothing.zip`.

Running the command
-------------------

Next, open up your terminal and run the following command:

.. code::

   sct_smooth_spinalcord -i t1.nii.gz -s t1_seg.nii.gz

:Input arguments:
   - ``-i`` : The input image.
   - ``-s`` : A spinal cord segmentation mask corresponding to the input image. This is needed as ``sct_smooth_spinalcord`` performs a 1D smoothing operation following the cord centerline (as opposed to the cortical surface smoothing in FreeSurfer, which is 2D).

:Output files/folders:
   - ``t1_smooth.nii.gz`` : The input image, smoothed along the spinal cord.
   - ``warp_curve2straight.nii.gz`` : ``sct_smooth_spinalcord`` involves an intermediate straightening step, so this is the 4D warping field that defines the transform from the original curved anatomical image to the straightened image.
   - ``warp_straight2curve.nii.gz`` : ``sct_smooth_spinalcord`` involves an intermediate straightening step, so this is the 4D warping field that defines the inverse transform from the straightened anatomical image back to the original curved image.
   - ``straight_ref.nii.gz`` : The straightened input image produced by the intermediate straightening step. Can be re-used by other SCT functions that need a straight reference space.
   - ``straightening.cache`` : SCT functions that require straightening will check for this file. If it is present in the working directory, ``straight_ref.nii.gz`` and the two warping fields will be re-used, saving processing time.

After smoothing, the apparent noise is reduced, while the cord edges are preserved, allowing a more reliable segmentation on a second pass.

Spinal labeling
###############

In previous tutorials, only the vertebral and/or disc labels have been used for template-based registration and metric extraction. However, vertebral labeling only gives a “rough” idea of where the spinal nerves project in the spinal cord.

Knowing the position of the spinal levels (i.e. where the nerve roots connect to the cord) could be more informative from an anatomo-functional standpoint. For that purpose, SCT has integrated the work of `[Cadotte et al. AJNR 2015] <https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25523587/>`_, which provides a one-to-one probabilistic mapping between vertebral and spinal levels.

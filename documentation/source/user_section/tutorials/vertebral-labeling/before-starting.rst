Before starting this tutorial
#############################

1. Read through the following pages to familiarize yourself with key SCT concepts:

    * :ref:`qc`: Primer for SCT's Quality Control interface. After each step of this tutorial, you will be able to open a QC report that lets you easily evaluate the results of each command.

2. Make sure that you have the following files in your working directory:

   * ``single_subject/data/t2/t2.nii.gz`` : An anatomical spinal cord scan in the T1 contrast.
   * ``single_subject/data/t2/t2_seg.nii.gz`` : An 3D binary mask for the spinal cord.

   You can get these files by downloading :sct_tutorial_data:`data_vertebral-labeling.zip`.

.. note:: If you are :ref:`completing all of SCT's tutorials in sequence <completing-the-tutorials-in-sequence>`, your working directory should already contain the files needed for this tutorial.

3. Open a terminal and navigate to the ``single_subject/data/t2/`` directory:

.. code:: sh

   cd {PATH_TO_DOWNLOADED_DATA}/single_subject/data/t2/

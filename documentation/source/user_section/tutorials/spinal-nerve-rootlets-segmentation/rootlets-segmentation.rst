Spinal nerve rootlets segmentation
##################################

SCT provides a deep learning model for the segmentation of spinal nerve rootlets from T2*-weighted images.
The model is available in SCT v6.2 and higher via ``sct_deepseg -task seg_spinal_rootlets_t2w``.

This model was trained on 3D T2-weighted images and provides level-specific semantic segmentation (i.e., 2: C2 rootlet, 3: C3 rootlet, etc.) of the dorsal spinal nerve rootlets.

Run the following command to segment the spinal nerve rootlets from the input image:

.. code:: sh

   sct_deepseg -i t2.nii.gz -task seg_spinal_rootlets_t2w -qc ~/qc_singleSubj

:Input arguments:
    - ``-i`` : Input T2w image
    - ``-task`` : Task to perform. In our case, we use the ``seg_spinal_rootlets_t2w`` task.
    - ``-qc`` : Directory for Quality Control reporting. QC reports allow us to evaluate the segmentation slice-by-slice

:Output files/folders:
    - ``t2_seg.nii.gz`` : 3D level-specific segmentation (i.e., 2: C2 rootlet, 3: C3 rootlet, etc.) of the dorsal spinal nerve rootlets
    - ``t2_seg.json`` : JSON file containing details about the segmentation model

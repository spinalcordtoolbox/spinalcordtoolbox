Computing metrics using GM and WM segmentations
###############################################

This tutorial demonstrates how to use gray and white matter segmentations to compute shape metrics, as well as to extract signal intensity from anatomical data.

This tutorial is a follow-on for the :ref:`gm-wm-segmentation` tutorial.

.. note::

   The following tutorials make use of :ref:`Quality Control (QC) <qc>` reports for inspecting processed image data. Optionally, we also recommend trying out :ref:`fsleyes-instructions` to visualize the data from these tutorials, too.

SCT Course
**********

If you would prefer to learn how to use SCT in a guided workshop setting, we provide an in-person SCT course each year. You can learn more about past and future courses in the :ref:`course section<courses>`.


.. Note: The toctree below is required by Sphinx for the sidebar. However, the automatically generated sidebar isn't ideal, because ":maxdepth: 2" shows too many sections, but ":maxdepth: 1" doesn't show enough. To get around this, we set the toctree as `:hidden:`, then manually create a secondary TOC using bullet point lists (see above). This manual method produces e a good-looking hybrid of both of the 'max-depth' options.

.. Note 2: Both the hidden toctree (below) and the manual TOC (above) should be updated together. Make sure to use short titles in each section's page (since these will automatically be shown in the sidebar). But, feel free to use longer titles in the manual TOC, where there is more space.

Running through the tutorials in sequence
*****************************************

While each of these tutorials can be completed on its own, you can also run through all of them together in sequence. To do so, start by downloading the `full tutorial dataset <https://api.github.com/repos/spinalcordtoolbox/sct_tutorial_data/zipball/>`_, then extract it to your working directory. This download contains all of the necessary data files needed to run each tutorial in sequence. It also contains a handy script that demonstrates how to run all of the commands together as a pipeline.

Video tutorials
***************

SCT also has a `YouTube channel`_ which contains additional tutorials.

SCT Course
**********

We also organize a **free** in-person SCT course each year after the ISMRM conference. The course provides a guided walkthrough of SCT, with developers and researchers on-hand to provide support and to answer any questions you may have. If you’d like to be added to the mailing list for course announcements, please visit `this link <https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdvsXwLRj07bx85O2wPM9ut1sC-20dFKdTVe-OckyvkfncV3Q/viewform>`_.

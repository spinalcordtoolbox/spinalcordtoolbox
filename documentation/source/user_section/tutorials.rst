.. note::

   The following tutorials make use of :ref:`Quality Control (QC) <qc>` reports for inspecting processed image data. Optionally, we also recommend trying out :ref:`fsleyes-instructions` to visualize the data from these tutorials, too.

SCT Course
**********

If you would prefer to learn how to use SCT in a guided workshop setting, we provide an in-person SCT course each year. You can learn more about past and future courses in the :ref:`course section<courses>`.


.. Note: The TOC below is hidden because neither ":maxdepth: 2" nor ":maxdepth: 1" looks correct. Instead, we manually
         create our own table of contents using lists, and this will produce a good-looking hybrid of both options.

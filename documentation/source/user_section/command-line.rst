Command-Line Tools
##################

The command-line tools are named ``sct_*``; to see all the commands available from SCT, start a new Terminal and type ``sct`` then press "tab".

Each command-line tool has a dedicated documentation page where you will find its "help text", with each page linked below. To quickly search the help text of all of the tools at once, please navigate to the :ref:`all_tools` page and type Ctrl+F to search.

.. Note: The toctree below is required by Sphinx for the sidebar. However, the automatically generated sidebar isn't ideal, because ":maxdepth: 2" shows too many sections, but ":maxdepth: 1" doesn't show enough. To get around this, we set the toctree as `:hidden:`, then manually create a secondary TOC using bullet point lists (see above). This manual method produces e a good-looking hybrid of both of the 'max-depth' options.

.. Note 2: Both the hidden toctree (below) and the manual TOC (above) should be updated together. Make sure to use short titles in each section's page (since these will automatically be shown in the sidebar). But, feel free to use longer titles in the manual TOC, where there is more space.

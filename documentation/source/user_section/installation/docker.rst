Installation with Docker
------------------------

`Docker <https://www.docker.com/what-container/>`__ is a portable (Linux, macOS, Windows) container platform.

In the context of SCT, it can be used to test SCT in a specific OS environment; this is much faster than running a fully fledged virtual machine.

The instructions for installing Docker itself depend on the host operating system (that is, the operating system used *outside* Docker):

- :ref:`Docker on MacOS <docker-install-macos>`
- :ref:`Docker on Linux <docker-install-linux>`
- :ref:`Docker on Windows <docker-install-windows>`

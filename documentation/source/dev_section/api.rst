   Because SCT is not currently installable via pip, we strongly recommend against using SCT's Python API in your code. Instead, we ask that you stick with SCT's :ref:`command-line-tools`.

   This page is maintained primarily for internal use by SCT developers. If you have arrived at this page, please let us know so that we can update any links to this page.

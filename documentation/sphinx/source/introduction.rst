Introduction

SCT tools process MRI data (`NIfTI <https://nifti.nimh.nih.gov/>`_
files) and can do tasks such as:

- Automatic identification (segmentation) of the spinal cord
- Automatic vertebral labeling
- Segmentation of spinal cord white matter and gray matter
- Registration to template, and deformation (eg. straightening)
- Detection of anatomical highlights (eg. PMJ, spinal cord centerline)
- Correction (motion compensation, eddy currents correction)
- Measurements (for quantitative MRI)
- Help out with manual labeling and segmentation with a GUI

It also has low-level tools:

- Warping field creation and application
- NIFTI volume manipulation tools for common operations


You may now proceed to :ref:`installation` and :ref:`getting-started`.

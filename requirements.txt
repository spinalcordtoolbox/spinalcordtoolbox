# `matplotlib-inline` is an optional package that comes with `jupyter` for use with the '%matplotlib inline' directive.
# However, if the user runs `jupyter` from a separate environment and sets '%matplotlib inline', then SCT's
# environment will be missing this backend, and SCT scripts will crash when trying to import matplotlib. So, we install
# `matplotlib-inline` in our env by default to ensure that SCT scripts can be run in Jupyter notebooks without error.

# Fresh Windows installations may be missing the C++ runtime library required by scikit-image.
# Installing "Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable for Visual Studio" will fix this too, but
# we'd prefer not to burden users with another prerequisite. 
# NB: It's possible this fix gets included upstream in a future skimage release, see:

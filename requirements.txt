# Fresh Windows installations may be missing the C++ runtime library required by scikit-image.
# Installing "Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable for Visual Studio" will fix this too, but
# we'd prefer not to burden users with another prerequisite. 
# NB: It's possible this fix gets included upstream in a future skimage release, see:

# PyTorch's Linux/Windows distribution is very large due to its GPU support,
# but we only need that for training models. For users, use the CPU-only version
# (only available directly from the PyTorch project).
# The macOS version has never had GPU support, so doesn't need the workaround.

# Fresh Windows installations may be missing the C++ runtime library required by scikit-image.
# Installing "Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable for Visual Studio" will fix this too, but
# we'd prefer not to burden users with another prerequisite. 
# NB: It's possible this fix gets included upstream in a future skimage release, see:

# This is pinned to address an upstream breaking change from protobuf 4.21.0
# (Yes, you're reading that right. protobuf updated its major version from 3.20.1 to 4.21.0.)
# The protobuf update breaks Keras specifically, but we can remove the fix once we drop Keras in

# NB: Any lines marked with 'append_to_freeze' will be copied over to `requirements-freeze.txt` when creating SCT's
#     stable releases. We do this because `pip freeze` will not capture options (e.g. --extra-index-url) or
#     platform-specific requirements (e.g. sys.platform == 'win32')

# Fresh Windows installations may be missing the C++ runtime library required by scikit-image.
# Installing "Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable for Visual Studio" will fix this too, but
# we'd prefer not to burden users with another prerequisite. 
# NB: It's possible this fix gets included upstream in a future skimage release, see:
#     https://github.com/scikit-image/scikit-image/issues/4780#issuecomment-824678872
# (The version is pinned because this line gets copied to requirements-freeze.txt when preparing a release, not because we're avoiding bugs with a specific version. Feel free to update it to the latest version.)

# This pin is due to an incompatibility with pystrum==0.2, which is installed via voxelmorph -> neurite -> pystrum
# See also: https://github.com/adalca/pystrum/issues/9
# If pystrum is updated to 0.3, then we should replace this version pinning with `pystrum>=0.3`

# 1.7.0>onnxruntime>=1.5.1 required `brew install libomp` on macOS.
# So, pin to >=1.7.0 to avoid having to ask users to install libomp.

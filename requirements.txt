# So, pin to 1.4.0 to avoid having to ask users to install libomp.
# ivadomed==2.5.0 would also do this, but #3035 is preventing that.

# PyTorch's Linux/Windows distribution is very large due to its GPU support,
# but we only need that for training models. For users, use the CPU-only version
# (only available directly from the PyTorch project).
# The macOS version has never had GPU support, so doesn't need the workaround.

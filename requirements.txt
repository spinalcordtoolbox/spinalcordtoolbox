# Fresh Windows installations may be missing the C++ runtime library required by scikit-image.
# Installing "Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable for Visual Studio" will fix this too, but
# we'd prefer not to burden users with another prerequisite. 
# NB: It's possible this fix gets included upstream in a future skimage release, see:

# (The version is pinned because this line gets copied to requirements-freeze.txt when preparing a release, not because we're avoiding bugs with a specific version. Feel free to update it to the latest version.)

# Currently, we pin dipy such that 1.5.0 gets installed. However, dipy 1.5.0 is incompatible with
# numpy>=1.25.0. So, we have to pin numpy on their behalf.

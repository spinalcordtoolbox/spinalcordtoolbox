# to cover other other platforms Linux distros, we use docker or WSL images.
# These are therefore not perfectly accurate tests, but hopefully good enough.

# We haven't figured out how to factor this -- to avoid the boilerplate. It seems impossible.
# Github Actions is just not flexible enough. The best it has is the build matrix, but:
# - the bad null case: if the build matrix generates no jobs, the UI prints a placeholder with the unevaluated `name:` expression like `${{matrix.name || matrix.os || 'Nightlies' }}`
# - you cannot refer to the matrix parameters in a job's `if:`, so it is impossible to decide whether to run a job or not; it is possible to do so in a *step*'s `if:`. See https://github.community/t/conditional-matrices/17206/2.
#   ideally we would have a build matrix with all the platforms covered
#   ```
#   if: ${{ !matrix.nightly || (github.event_name == 'schedule' || github.event_name == 'push') }}
#   ```
#   but it's not allowed; that second half is legal but `matrix.nightly` is not.
# - there's no way to mix the docker-based platforms with the windows ones in the same build matrix anyway, because specifying `container:`, even with an empty/undefined string, tries blindly to use the docker scripts

# To keep feedback fast, we only run a selection of common platforms in CI
# The others run nightly, and on changes to one of the central branches mentioned above in `on:`.

    # To support OSes that Travis doesn't, we mix in Docker images.
    # Any such OS (CentOS, etc) will be booted in docker instead.
    # OSes in this case are marked by using IMAGE: instead of dist:.
    #
    # Since Docker images are usually very barebones,
    # these need a DEPS command that should install the
    # basic dependencies needed for conda etc.
    #
    # Testing this way is imperfect -- these docker images are not
    # identical to freshly installed VMs, and by using docker we're
    # mismatching kernels, but it is a lot better than not testing.

"""
A wrapper for pytest to provide backwards compatability for `sct_testing`.

Context: SCT previously provided its own custom testing framework using a
         script called `sct_testing`. This was replaced with `pytest`, however
         sct_testing is likely still remembered by users, and may still be in
         use in scripts. So, this script provides a way to use `sct_testing`
         to run the pytest test suite.
